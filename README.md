This is a very simple project! Seeing as recruiters only seem to care
about "amount of projects worked on "or amount of code lines published",
helloworlder will build infinite projects in any language you desire.

Does it have unit tests? dont need em. Does it compile? probably not. 
Is it useful? nope. Does it actually run? Who cares!! does it have lines of
code? You can bet your entire ass it has lines of code.
